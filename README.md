# ScottPlot

**ScottPlot is a free and open-source interactive plotting library for .NET** 
which makes it easy to interactively display data in a variety of formats. You can generate line plots, bar charts, error charts, scatter plots, etc.,
with just a few lines of code (see the [ScottPlot Cookbook](/cookbook/) for examples).

In graphical environments plots can be displayed interactively (left-click-drag to pan and right-click-drag to zoom) and in console applications plots can be created and saved as images. 

ScottPlot targets multiple frameworks (.NET Framework 4.5 and .NET Core 3.0), has user controls for WinForms and WPF, and is available on NuGet.


## Quickstart
1. Install ScottPlot using [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/ScottPlot/)
2. Drag/Drop the ScottPlotUC (from the toolbox) onto your Form
3. Add the following code to your startup sequence

```cs
double[] xs = new double[] {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
double[] ys = new double[] {1, 4, 9, 16, 25};
scottPlotUC1.plt.PlotScatter(xs, ys);
scottPlotUC1.Render();
```

You now have an interactive graph! 

Check the [ScottPlot Cookbook](/cookbook) to learn how to further customize your plots.

## Features

### Multiple Plot Types
ScottPlot can make scatter plots, box plots, step plots, and even financial plots (candlestick and OHLC plots). The signal plot is a type of scatter plot optimized for speed when plotting evenly-spaced data. Signal plots are capable of displaying _tens of millions_ of data points at >100 Hz framerates allowing comfortable interaction using the mouse. The _plot types.exe_ application (in [/demos](/demos)) demonstrates this.

### Animated Plots
If you plot a double array with ScottPlot, later updating the original array automatically updates the data in ScottPlot. The _animated sine wave.exe_ application (in [/demos](/demos)) demonstrates this by plotting an array then uses a timer to update it continuously. Note that the graph is still mouse-interactive (panning and zooming) while continuously updating.

### Highspeed Data Visualization
ScottPlot can plot data quickly allowing for high framerates. The _audio monitor.exe_ demo (in [/demos](/demos)) uses two ScottPlot plots to display audio data in real time. The signal (PCM, top) and frequency (FFT, bottom) components are continuously updated at a high framerate and are both mouse-interactive.
