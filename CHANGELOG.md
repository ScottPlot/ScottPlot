* Improved display of manual tick labels (#724) _Thanks @bclehmann_

## ScottPlot 4.1.4-beta
* User controls have been extensively redesigned (#683)
  * All user controls are almost entirely logic-free and pass events to `ScottPlot.Control`, a shared common back-end module which handles mouse interaction and pixel/coordinate conversions.
  * Controls no longer have a `Configure()` method with numerous named arguments, but instead a `Configuration` field with XML-documented public fields to customize behavior.

## ScottPlot 4.1.0

In November, 2020 ScottPlot 4.0 branched into a permanent `stable` branch, and ScottPlot 4.1 began development as beta / pre-release in the main branch. ScottPlot 4.0 continues to be maintained, but modifications are aimed at small bugfixes rather than large refactoring or the addition of new features. ScottPlot 4.1 merged into the master branch in November, 2020 (#605). Improvements are focused at enhanced performance, improved thread safety, support for multiple axes, and options for data validation.

* **Most plotting methods are unchanged so many users will not experience any breaking changes.**
* **Axis Limits**
  * Axis limits are described by a `AxisLimits` struct (previously `double[]` was used)
  * Methods which modify axis limits do not return anything (previously they returned `double[]`)
  * To get the latest axis limits call `Plot.AxisLimits()` which returns a `AxisLimits` object
* **Multiple Axes**
  * Multiple axes are now supported! There is no change to the traditional workflow if this feature is not used.
  * Most axis methods accept a `xAxisIndex` and `yAxisIndex` arguments to specify which axes they will modify or return
  * Most plottable objects have `xAxisIndex` and `yAxisIndex` fields which specify which axes they will render on
  * You can enable a second Y and X axis by calling `YLabel2` and `XLabel2()`
  * You can obtain an axis by calling `GetXAxis(xAxisIndex)` or `GetYAxis(yAxisIndex)`, then modify its public fields to customize its behavior
  * The default axes (left and bottom) both use axis index `0`
  * The secondary axes (right and top) both use axis index `1`
  * You can create additional axes by calling `Plot.AddAxis()` and customize it by modifying fields of the `Axis` it returns.
* **Layout**
  * The layout is re-calculated on every render, so it automatically adjusts to accommodate axis labels and ticks.
  * To achieve extra space around the data area, call `Layout()` to supply a minimum size for each axis.
  * To achieve a frameless plot where the data area fills the full figure, call `LayoutFrameless()`
* **Some namespaces and class names have changed**
  * The `Plottable` base class has been replaced with an `IPlottable` interface
  * Plottables have been renamed and moved into a `Plottable` namespace (e.g., `PlottableScatter` is  now `Plottable.ScatterPlot`)
  * Several enums have been renamed
* **The Settings module has been greatly refactored**
  * It is still private, but you can request it with `Plot.GetSettings()`
  * Many of its objects implement `IRenderable`, so their customization options are stored at the same level as their render methods.
* **The Render system is now stateless**
  * `Bitmap` objects are never stored. The `Render()` method will create and return a new `Bitmap` when called, or will render onto an existing `Bitmap` if it is supplied as an argument. This allows controls to manage their own performance optimization by optionally re-using a `Bitmap` for multiple renders.
  * Drawing is achieved with `using` statements which respect all `IDisposable` drawing objects, improving thread safety and garbage collection performance.

* Improved mouse wheel zoom-to-cursor and middle-click-drag rectangle zoom in the WPF control for systems that use display scaling (#490) _Thanks @nashilnik_
* The `Configure()` method of user controls now has a `lowQualityAlways` argument to let the user easily enable/disable anti-aliasing at the control level. Previously this was only configurable by reaching into the control's plot object and calling its `AntiAlias()` method. (#499) _Thanks @RachamimYaakobov_
* SignalXY now supports parallel processing (#500) _Thanks @StendProg_
* SignalXY now respects index-based render limits (#493, #500) _Thanks @StendProg and @envine_

## ScottPlot 4.0.38
* Improved `Plot.PlotFillAboveBelow()` rendering of data with a non-zero baseline (#477) _Thanks @el-aasi_
* Added `Plot.PlotWaterfall()` for easy creation of waterfall-style bar plots (#463, #476) _Thanks @bclehmann_
* Axis tick labels can be displayed using notations other than base 10 by supplying `Plot.Ticks()` with `base` and `prefix` arguments, allowing axes that display binary (e.g., `0b100110`) or hexadecimal (eg., `0x4B0D10`) tick labels (#469, #457) _Thanks @bclehmann_
* Added options to `PlotBar()` to facilitate customization of text displayed above bars when `showValue` is enabled (#483) _Thanks @WillemWever_
* Plot objects are colored based on a pre-defined set of colors. The default colorset (category10) is the same palette of colors used by matplotlib. A new `Colorset` module has been created to better define this behavior, and `Plot.Colorset()` makes it easy to plot data using alternative colorsets. (#481)
* Fixed a bug that caused instability when a population plot is zoomed-out so much that its fractional distribution curve is smaller than a single pixel (#480) _Thanks @HowardWhile_
* Added `Plot.Remove()` method to make it easier to specifically remove an individual plottable after it has been plotted. `Plot.Clear()` is similar, but designed to remove classes of plot types rather than a specific plot object. (#479) _Thanks @cstyx and @Resonanz_
* Signal plots can now be created with a defined `minRenderIndex` (in addition to the already-supported `maxRenderIndex`) to facilitate partial display of large arrays (#474) _Thanks @bclehmann_

## ScottPlot 4.0.37
* Fixed a long-running issue related to strong assembly versioning that caused the WPF control to fail to render in the Visual Studio designer in .NET Framework (but not .NET Core) projects (#473, #466, #356) _Thanks @bhairav-thakkar, @riquich, @Helitune-RobMcKay, and @iu2kxv_
* User controls now also target `net472` (while still supporting `net461` and `netcoreapp3.0`) to produce a build folder with just 3 DLLs (compared to over 100 when building with .NET Framework 4.6.1)

## ScottPlot 4.0.36
* `PlotSignal()` and `PlotSignalXY()` plots now have an optional `useParallel` argument (and public property on the objects they return) to allow the user to decide whether parallel or sequential calculations will be performed. (#454, #419, #245, #72) _Thanks @StendProg_
* Improved minor tick alignment to prevent rare single-pixel artifacts (#417)
* Improved horizontal axis tick label positions in ruler mode (#453)
* Added a `Statistics.Interpolation` module to generate smooth interpolated splines from a small number of input data points. See advanced statistics cookbook example for usage information. (#459) _Thanks Hans-Peter Moser_
* Improved automatic axis adjustment when adding bar plots with negative values (#461, #462) _Thanks @bclehmann_
* Created `Drawing.Colormaps` module which has over a dozen colormaps for easily converting a fractional value to a color for use in plotting or heatmap displays (#457, #458) _Thanks @bclehmann_
* Updated `Plot.Clear()` to accept any `Plottable` as an argument, and all `Plottable` objects of the same type will be cleared (#464) _Thanks @imka-code_

## ScottPlot 4.0.35
* Added `processEvents` argument to `formsPlot2.Render()` to provide a performance enhancement when linking axes of two `FormsPlot` controls together (by calling `Plot.MatchAxis()` from the control's `AxesChanged` event, as seen in the _Linked Axes_ demo application) (#451, #452) _Thanks @StendProg and @robokamran_
* New `Plot.PlotVectorField()` method for displaying vector fields (sometimes called quiver plots) (#438, #439, #440) _Thanks @bclehmann and @hhubschle_
* Included an experimental colormap module which is likely to evolve over subsequent releases (#420, #424, #442) _Thanks @bclehmann_
* `PlotScatterHighlight()` was created as a type of scatter plot designed specifically for applications where "show value on hover" functionality is desired. Examples are both in the cookbook and WinForms and WPF demo applications. (#415, #414) _Thanks @bclehmann and @StendProg_
* `PlotRadar()` is a new plot type for creating Radar plots (also called spider plots or star plots). See cookbook and demo application for examples. (#428, #430) _Thanks @bclehmann_
* `PlotPlolygons()` is a new performance-optimized variant of `PlotPolygon()` designed for displaying large numbers of complex shapes (#426) _Thanks @StendProg_
* The WinForms control's `Configure()` now has a `showCoordinatesTooltip` argument to continuously display the position at the tip of the cursor as a tooltip (#410) _Thanks @jcbeppler_
* User controls now use SHIFT (previously ALT) to lock the horizontal axis and ALT (previously SHIFT) while left-click-dragging for zoom-to-region. Holding CTRL+SHIFT while right-click-dragging now zooms evenly, without X/Y distortion. (#436) _Thanks @tomwimmenhove and @StendProg_
* Parallel processing is now enabled by default. Performance improvements will be most noticeable on Signal plots. (#419, #245, #72)
* `Plot.PlotBar()` now has an `autoAxis` argument (which defaults `true`) that automatically adjusts the axis limits so the base of the bar graphs touch the edge of the plot area. (#406)
* OSX-specific DLLs are now only retrieved by NuGet on OSX (#433, #211, #212)
* Pie charts can now be made with `plt.PlotPie()`. See cookbook and demo application for examples. (#421, #423) _Thanks @bclehmann_
* `ScottPlot.FormsPlotViewer(Plot)` no longer resets the new window's plot to the default style (#416)  _Thanks @StendProg_
* Controls now have a `recalculateLayoutOnMouseUp` option to prevent resetting of manually-defined data area padding

## ScottPlot 4.0.34
* Improve display of `PlotSignalXY()` by not rendering markers when zoomed very far out (#402) _Thanks @gobikulandaisamy_
* Optimized rendering of solid lines which have a user-definable `LineStyle` property. This modification improves grid line rendering and increases performance for most types of plots. (#401, #327) _Thanks @bukkideme and @Ichibot200_

## ScottPlot 4.0.33
* Force grid lines to always draw using anti-aliasing. This compensates for a bug in `System.Drawing` that may cause diagonal line artifacts to appear when the user controls were panned or zoomed. (#401, #327) _Thanks @bukkideme and @Ichibot200_

## ScottPlot 4.0.32
* User controls now have a `GetMouseCoordinates()` method which returns the DPI-aware position of the mouse in graph coordinates (#379, #380) _Thanks @bclehmann_
* Default grid color was lightened in the user controls to match the default style (#372)
* New `PlotSignalXY()` method for high-speed rendering of signal data that has unevenly-spaced X coordinates (#374, #375) _Thanks @StendProg and @LogDogg_
* Modify `Tools.Log10()` to return `0` instead of `NaN`, improving automatic axis limit detection (#376, #377) _Thanks @bclehmann_
* WpfPlotViewer and FormsPlotViewer launch in center of parent window (#378)
* Improve reliability of `Plot.AxisAutoX()` and `Plot.AxisAutoY()` (#382)
* The `Configure()` method of FormsPlot and WpfPlot controls now have `middleClickMarginX` and `middleClickMarginY` arguments which define horizontal and vertical auto-axis margin used for middle-clicking. Setting horizontal margin to 0 is typical when plotting signals. (#383)
* `Plot.Grid()` and `Plot.Ticks()` now have a `snapToNearestPixel` argument which controls whether these lines appear anti-aliased or not. For static images non-anti-aliased grid lines and tick marks look best, but for continuously-panning plots anti-aliased lines look better. The default behavior is to enable snapping to the nearest pixel, consistent with previous releases. (#384)
* Mouse events (MouseDown, MouseMove, etc.) are now properly forwarded to the FormsPlot control (#390) _Thanks @Minu476_
* Improved rendering of very small candlesticks and OHLCs in financial plots
* Labeled plottables now display their label in the ToString() output. This is useful when viewing plottables listed in the FormsPlot settings window #391 _Thanks @Minu476_
* Added a Statistics.Finance module with methods for creating Simple Moving Average (SMA) and Bollinger band technical indicators to Candlestick and OHLC charts. Examples are in the cookbook and demo program. (#397) _Thanks @Minu476_
* Scatter plots, filled plots, and polygon plots now support Xs and Ys which contain `double.NaN` #396
* Added support for line styles to Signal plots (#392) _Thanks @bukkideme_

## ScottPlot 4.0.31
* Created `Plot.PlotBarGroups()` for easier construction of grouped bar plots from 2D data (#367) _Thanks @bclehmann_
* Plot.PlotScaleBar() adds an L-shaped scalebar to the corner of the plot (#363)
* Default grid color lightened from #D3D3D3 (Color.LightGray) to #EFEFEF (#372)
* Improved error reporting for scatter plots (#369) _Thanks @JagDTalcyon_
* Improve pixel alignment by hiding grid lines and snapping tick marks that are 1px away from the lower left edge (#359)
* PlotText() ignores defaults to upperLeft alignment when rotation is used (#362)
* Improved minor tick positioning to prevent cases where minor ticks are 1px away from major ticks (#373)

## ScottPlot 4.0.30
* `Plot.PlotCandlestick()` and `Plot.PlotOHLC()`
  * now support `OHLC` objects with variable widths defined with a new `timeSpan` argument in the OHLC constructor. (#346) _Thanks @Minu476_
  * now support custom up/down colors including those with transparency (#346) _Thanks @Minu476_
  * have a new `sequential` argument to plot data based on array index rather than `OHLC.time`. This is a new, simpler way to display unevenly-spaced data (e.g., gaps over weekends) in a way that makes the gaps invisible. (#346) _Thanks @Minu476_
* Fixed a marker/line alignment issue that only affeced low-density Signal plots on Linux and MacOS (#340) _Thanks @SeidChr_
* WPF control now appears in Toolbox (#151) _Thanks @RalphLAtGitHub_
* Plot titles are now center-aligned with the data area, not the figure. This improves the look of small plots with titles. (#365) _Thanks @Resonanz_
* Fixed bug that ignored `Configure(enableRightClickMenu: false)` in WPF and WinForms user controls. (#365) _Thanks @thunderstatic_
* Updated `Configure(enableScrollWheelZoom: false)` to disable middle-click-drag zooming. (#365) _Thanks @eduhza_
* Added color mixing methods to ScottPlot.Drawing.GDI (#361)
* Middle-click-drag zooming now respects locked axes (#353) _Thanks @LogDogg_
* Improved user control zooming of high-precision DateTime axis data (#351) _Thanks @bukkideme_
* Plot.AxisBounds() now lets user set absolute bounds for drag and pan operations (#349) _Thanks @LogDogg_
* WPF control uses improved Bitmap conversion method (#350)
* Function plots have improved handling of functions with infinite values (#370) _Thanks @bclehmann_

## ScottPlot 4.0.29
* `Plot.PlotFill()` can be used to make scatter plots with shaded regions. Giving it a single pair of X/Y values (`xs, ys`) lets you shade beneath the curve to the `baseline` value (which defaults to 0). You can also give it a pair of X/Y values (`xs1, ys1, xs2, ys2`) and the area between the two curves will be shaded (the two curves do not need to be the same length). See cookbook for examples. (#255) _Thanks @ckovamees_ 
* `DataGen.Range()` now has `includeStop` argument to include the last value in the returned array.
* `Tools.Pad()` has been created to return a copy of a given array padded with data values on each side. (#255) _Thanks @ckovamees_
* [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/) style can be activated using `Plot.Style(Style.Seaborn)` (#339)
* The `enableZooming` argument in `WpfPlot.Configure()` and `FormsPlot.Configure()` has been replaced by two arguments `enableRightClickZoom` and `enableScrollWheelZoom` (#338) _Thanks Zach_
* Improved rendering of legend items for polygons and filled plots (#341) _Thanks @SeidChr_
* Improved Linux rendering of legend items which use thick lines: axis spans, fills, polygons, etc. (#340) _Thanks @SeidChr_
* Addded `Plot.PlotFillAboveBelow()` to create a shaded line plot with different colors above/below the baseline. (#255) _Thanks @ckovamees_
* Improved rendering in Linux and MacOS by refactoring the font measurement system (#340) _Thanks @SeidChr_

## ScottPlot 4.0.28
* `Ticks()` now has arguments for numericStringFormat (X and Y) to make it easy to customize formatting of tick labels (percentage, currency, scientific notation, etc.) using standard [numeric format strings](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/base-types/standard-numeric-format-strings). Example use is demonstrated in the cookbook. (#336) _Thanks @deiruch_
* The right-click menu can now be more easily customized by writing a custom menu to `FormsPlot.ContextMenuStrip` or `WpfPlot.ContextMenu`. Demonstrations of both are in the demo application. (#337) _Thanks @Antracik_

## ScottPlot 4.0.27
* `Plot.Polygon()` can now be used to plot polygons from X/Y points (#255) _Thanks @ckovamees_
* User controls now have an "open in new window" item in their right-click menu (#280)
* Plots now have offset notation and multiplier notation disabled by default. Layouts are automatically calculated before the first render, or manually after MouseUp events in the user controls. (#310)
* `Plot.Annotation()` allows for the placement of text on the figure using pixel coordinates (not unit coordinates on the data grid). This is useful for creating custom static labels or information messages. (#321) _Thanks @SeidChr_
* `FormsPlot.MouseDoubleClicked` event now passes a proper `MouseEventArgs` instead of `null` (#331) _Thanks @ismdiego_
* Added a right-click menu to `WpfPlot` with items (save image, copy image, open in new window, help, etc.) similar to `FormsPlot`

## ScottPlot 4.0.26
* The `ScottPlot.WPF` package (which provides the `WpfPlot` user control) now targets .NET Framework 4.7.2 (in addition to .NET Core 3.0), allowing it to be used in applications which target either platform. The ScottPlot demo application now targets .NET Framework 4.7.2 which should be easier to run on most Windows systems. (#333)
* The `ScottPlot.WinForms` package (which produves the `FormsPlot` control) now only targets .NET Framework 4.6.1 and .NET Core 3.0 platforms (previously it also had build targets for .NET Framework 4.7.2 and .NET Framework 4.8). It is important to note that no functionality was lost here. (#330, #333)

## ScottPlot 4.0.25
* `PlotBar()` now supports displaying values above each bar graph by setting the `showValues` argument.
* `PlotPopulations()` has extensive capabilities for plotting grouped population data using box plots, bar plots, box and whisper plots, scatter data with distribution curves, and more! See the cookbook for details. (#315)
* `Histogram` objects now have a `population` property.
* `PopulationStats` has been renamed to `Population` and has additional properties and methods useful for reporting population statistics.
* Improved grid rendering rare artifacts which appear as unwanted diagnal lines when anti-aliasing is disabled. (#327)

## ScottPlot 4.0.24

* Fixed bug that affected the `ySpacing` argument of `Plot.Grid()`
* `Plot.Add()` makes it easy to add a custom `Plottable` to the plot
* `Plot.XLabels()` and `Plot.YLabels()` can now accept just a string array (x values are auto-populated as a consecutive series of numbers).
* Aliased `Plot.AxisAuto()` to `Plot.AutoAxis()` and `Plot.AutoScale()` to make this function easier to locate for users who may have experience with other plot libraries. (#309) _Thanks @Resonanz_
* Empty plots now render grid lines, ticks, and tick labels (#313)
* New plot type: Error bars. They allow the user to define error bar size in all 4 directions by calling `plt.PlotErrorBars()`. (#316) _Thanks @zrolfs_

* Fixed a bug affecting the `equalAxes` argument in `FormsPlot.Configure()` (#272)
* Made all `Plot.Axis` methods return axis limits as `double[]` (previously many of them returned `void`)
* Added overload for `Plot.PlotLine()` which accepts a slope, offset, and start and end X points to make it easy to plot a linear line with known formula. Using PlotFormula() will produce the same output, but this may be simpler to use for straight lines.
* Added `rSquared` property to linear regression fits (#290) _Thanks @bclehmann and @StendProg_

* Every `Plot` function now returns a `Plottable`. When creating things like scatter plots, text, and axis lines, the returned object can now be used to update the data, position, styling, or call plot-type-specific methods.
* Right-click menu now displays ScottPlot and .NET Framework version
* Improved rendering of extremely zoomed-out signals 
* Rendering speed increased now that `Format32bppPArgb` is the default PixelFormat (#83) _Thanks @StendProg_

* User controls now render graphs with anti-alias mode off (faster) while the mouse is being dragged. Upon release a high quality render is performed.

## ScottPlot 3.0.8
_Published on [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/profiles/ScottPlot) on 2019-08-04_
* WPF User Control: A ScottPlotWPF user control was created to allow provide a simple mouse-interactive ScottPlot control to WPF applications. It is not as full-featured as the winforms control (it lacks a right-click menu and click-and-drag functions), but it is simple to review the code (<100 lines) and easy to use.
* New plot type: `plt.AxisSpan()` shades a region of the graph (semi-transparency is supported)
* Ticks: Vertical ticks no longer overlap with vertical axis label (#47) _Thanks @bukkideme_
* Ticks: When axis tick labels contain very large or very small numbers, scientific notation mode is engaged
* Ticks: Horizontal tick mark spacing increased to prevent overlapping
* Ticks: Vertical tick mark spacing increased to be consistent with horizontal tick spacing
